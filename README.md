# 🧠 Ahmed's AI-Powered Portfolio Chatbot

This is a fully serverless AI portfolio website powered by:
- OpenAI + Vercel AI SDK
- pgvector (NeonDB) + Drizzle ORM
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TailwindCSS v4
- Embedding-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Visitors can chat with an AI version of me (Ahmed), trained on my résumé and personal documents. The chatbot uses OpenAI's GPT-4o to respond only using facts embedded into a vector database — no hallucinations.
